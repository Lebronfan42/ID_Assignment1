The website created is a revamp of an existing website called travisscott.com. The original website is the official website of the music artist Travis Scott. The website sells Travis Scott merch, vinyl, and tickets for his upcoming tour. My website aims to do what the original website aimed to do, which is to allow fans of Travis Scott to buy his merch and to sell tickets for upcoming tours.
## Design Process
The Website is designed to have a good user experience with good functionality, being able to achieve its goal of providing a platform for Travis Scott fans to buy tickets and merch. As most of Travis Scott’s fans are teenagers and young adults, the website needs to be appealing to them, having a minimalistic design with few words and more pictures. The websites should also have a simple color palette, following the color palette associated with Travis Scott, Brown, White, and Black. Users should also be able to easily find any product they want, by using search bars and filters to find the product they are looking for.
